Datapacks are a fairly new thing, so you may not know how to install one. It's easy. Just follow my steps:
1. Go to %appdata% and find the .minecraft folder. 
2. Once you're in the .minecraft folder, go to saves.
3. Select the world you want. 
4. Make a new folder called datapacks in your world's folder. (if there isn't one in there already)
5. Extract Simple Minecraft Changes and put the folder in the datapacks folder.
6. Open up your world in Minecraft. 
7. Do the command /datapack list. My datapack should be there.
8. Then do /datapack enable "file/Simple Minecraft Changes" last.
9. That should enable my datapack. If that doesn't work, you may change the name of my folder or check what you did wrong online.
10. Enjoy!

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR MINECRAFT 1.13. THIS WILL NOT WORK ON ANY OTHER VERSION, BUT MAYBE SNAPSHOTS.
